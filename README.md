Redirects to a user's profile picture on any of the supported social networks.

Currently supported:

Looking for an easy way to plug this service into React? Check out [react-avatar](https://github.com/Sitebase/react-avatar).

Example:

![JorgenEvens on Twitter](https://avatar-redirect.appspot.com/twitter/JorgenEvens?size=bigger)

## Deployment

### Google App Engine

Requires the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) to be installed

Modify any of the settings in the `app.yaml` file.

```sh
gcloud config set project <project-id>
gcloud app deploy
```

### Heroku

Push this repository to a Heroku app or use the Deploy to Heroku button.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

## Usage

Each avatar URL follows the same base format which is `<base-url>/<network-name>/<user-name>`, for Twitter this would be `https://avatar-redirect.appspot.com/twitter/jorgenevens`.

If you are simply trying to show an avatar that would look something like this in HTML:

```html
<img src="https://avatar-redirect.appspot.com/twitter/jorgenevens"
    alt="JorgenEvens on Twitter" />
```

## Configuration

The app is configured using environment variables which you either add to your `app.yaml` file or set using the Heroku CLI / Dashboard.
